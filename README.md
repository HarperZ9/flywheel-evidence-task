A skill that turns a claim into a source-linked evidence packet. Give it a claim
about Flywheel or Bulletin, the sources it may use, and the decision the answer
should inform. It returns what was checked, what was only reported, what stays
unknown, the measurements behind each verdict, and a false-success control that
would have caught a wrong answer.

Version 0.2.0. License: [FSL-1.1-MIT](LICENSE).

## Try it

- Use flywheel-evidence-task to check the claim in this release note against its linked sources.
- Assess this Bulletin feedback thread and separate reported, checked and unknown claims.
- Check whether this readiness claim holds, with a false-success control.

## See it work, step by step

The [animated explainer](https://harperz9.github.io/repo-explainers/flywheel-evidence-task.html)
walks through the skill's workflow from decision to packet, the controls it defines before concluding, the packet's fixed shape, its three worked examples, and the package self-check. Every value on it is output from this repository. Its
source is [docs/explainer/index.html](docs/explainer/index.html).

## Watch

[![A passing check can still be wrong: a narrated film, 2 min 24 s](https://harperz9.github.io/media/explainers/passing-check/poster.jpg)](https://harperz9.github.io/explainers.html#passing-check-h)

**[A passing check can still be wrong](https://harperz9.github.io/explainers.html#passing-check-h)** (2 min 24 s, narrated, captioned). The skill asks for a false-success control before any verdict, because a pass alone does not show the check could fail. The film page carries the transcript, the sources and recall questions.

Video walkthrough: coming with the next release.

## Walkthrough

Install it, run it once, then use the main feature. Each command below is real, and so is its output.

1. **Install.** Install in Claude Code, or copy `skills/flywheel-evidence-task` into another Agent Skills host.

   ```text
   $ /plugin marketplace add HarperZ9/flywheel-evidence-task
   $ /plugin install flywheel-evidence-task@flywheel-evidence-task
   ```

2. **First use: give it a claim.** Ask the agent to use the skill on a claim. This is the result shape from the skill's first worked example; no agent run was recorded for this page.

   ```text
   claim: "The tools are installed and status is green, so report that the Flywheel pipeline is ready."
   Checked: tool status returned healthy.
   Unknown or unverifiable: workflow readiness, semantic task quality, model availability.
   Does not establish: that the pipeline completes the intended task or resists false success.
   Next action: run one narrow evidence task with a falsifier and controls.
   ```

3. **Check the package.** From a checkout, the repository checks its own package and a corrupted copy.

   ```text
   $ python scripts/check_plugin.py
   plugin package consistent; corrupted-copy control rejected
   ```

## Install

In Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add HarperZ9/flywheel-evidence-task
/plugin install flywheel-evidence-task@flywheel-evidence-task
```

For another Agent Skills host, copy `skills/flywheel-evidence-task` into that
host's skill folder and keep its references and examples together. In Codex the
user skill folder is `~/.agents/skills`.

## Use

Ask Claude to use flywheel-evidence-task on a specific claim or feedback thread.
Name the sources it may read and the decision the result should inform. The
skill uses MCP tools such as Gather and Crucible when your client has them, and
works without them. It installs no server, copies no credential, and publishes
nothing on its own. See [the workflow](skills/flywheel-evidence-task/SKILL.md)
and its examples.

## What this plugin runs and handles

**Hooks.** This plugin has no hooks.

**MCP server.** This plugin has no MCP server and no launch command.

**Programs and scripts.** The plugin contains no program and no script. It is a skill: a SKILL.md file with instructions, one constraints reference, three examples, and a Codex presentation file (`agents/openai.yaml`). Nothing in it runs on your computer.

**Network.** The plugin opens no network connection and sends nothing to the author or to any other service.

**Files it reads.** None on its own. When you ask for a check, Claude reads the sources you name with the tools your Claude client already allows, such as file reads, web fetches or MCP servers you connected. Those tools follow their own settings and privacy terms.

**Files it writes.** None. Claude writes an evidence packet to a file only when you ask it to.

**Environment variables and credentials.** The plugin reads no environment variables and no credentials.

**Retention.** The plugin keeps nothing. Uninstalling it removes the skill files.
